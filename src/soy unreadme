"But I
 must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I wil
 l give you a complete accou
 nt of the system, and expoun
 d the actual
  teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or a
  voids pleasu
 re itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationall
  obtain pain o
 f itself, 
 because it is pain
 , but because occasionally 
 circumstances occur in which 
 toil and pa
 in can procure him some great pleasure.
  To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage f
  rom it? But who has any right to find
   faul
  t with a ma
  n who
   chooses 
  to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one w
ho avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?"
